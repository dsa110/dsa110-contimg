# CODEOWNERS for documentation
#
# This file assigns reviewers for documentation-related changes. It is intentionally
# general to include both human developer teams and AI agent accounts/teams.
# Replace placeholders with your real teams/usernames when available.

# Primary docs surfaces
/mkdocs.yml                          @docs-team @maintainers @ai-agents
/docs/javascripts/**                 @frontend-team @docs-team @maintainers @ai-agents

# All documentation content (fallback)
/docs/**                             @docs-team @maintainers @ai-agents

# Optional: sub-area ownership (customize as teams exist)
/docs/reference/**                   @reference-owners @docs-team @ai-agents
/docs/operations/**                  @ops-owners @docs-team @ai-agents

# If your org does not yet have these teams, temporarily set a real user here
# to avoid GitHub ignoring CODEOWNERS lines with unknown owners.
# Example:
# /docs/**                             @your-username
# /mkdocs.yml                          @your-username
