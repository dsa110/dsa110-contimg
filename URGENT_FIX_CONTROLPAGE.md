# URGENT: ControlPage.tsx File Corrupted

## Problem
The file `/data/dsa110-contimg/frontend/src/pages/ControlPage.tsx` was truncated at line 660 during editing.

## Last Known Good State
The file should be approximately 865 lines (from earlier session).

## Immediate Actions

### Option 1: Restore from your IDE's local history
If you're using VS Code or another IDE, use "Local History" or "Timeline" to restore the file to before it was truncated.

### Option 2: Use the existing build
The current frontend build (`/data/dsa110-contimg/frontend/dist/`) from earlier today (Oct 28 15:26) has the complete calibration enhancements **without** the existing tables UI. This build is functional and can be used as-is.

The backend for existing tables is complete and working. Just the UI addition is pending.

### Option 3: Rebuild the Complete File
I can provide the complete ControlPage.tsx content, but it's 865+ lines. Would you prefer:
1. I write the full file (will take several messages due to size)
2. You restore from IDE history
3. We continue with the current build (existing tables work in auto mode, just no UI to switch to manual)

## What Was Working Before Corruption

The file had:
- ✓ All imports (including useExistingCalTables)
- ✓ State initialization with use_existing_tables: 'auto'
- ✓ MS selection and metadata display
- ✓ Calibrator match display
- ✓ Workflow banner
- ✓ Convert tab (full UVH5 conversion)
- ✓ Calibrate tab with:
  - Checkboxes for K/BP/G selection
  - Basic parameters (Field ID, RefAnt)
  - Advanced options (gain solint, calmode, min PB, flagging)
  - Run Calibration button
- ✓ Apply tab
- ✓ Image tab
- ✓ Recent Jobs table
- ✓ Job Logs with SSE streaming

## What Was Missing (To Be Added)

Between line ~720 (after RefAnt TextField, before Advanced Options Accordion), needed to add:

```typescript
<Divider sx={{ my: 2 }} />

<Typography variant="subtitle2" gutterBottom>
  Existing Calibration Tables
</Typography>

{selectedMS && (() => {
  const { data: existingTables } = useExistingCalTables(selectedMS);
  
  // ... (150 lines of existing tables UI - see EXISTING_TABLES_FEATURE_STATUS.md)
})()}

<Divider sx={{ my: 2 }} />
```

## Recommendation

**For now**: The current situation is:
- Backend: ✓ Fully functional (auto-select mode active by default)
- Frontend: ⚠️ File corrupted but last build still works
- Feature: Existing tables will be auto-discovered and used, just no UI to switch modes

**Next steps**:
1. Restore ControlPage.tsx from IDE history
2. Add the existing tables UI section (code in EXISTING_TABLES_FEATURE_STATUS.md)
3. Rebuild and test

OR

1. Continue with current build (feature works, just no manual mode UI)
2. Fix file corruption later when convenient

Let me know which approach you'd like to take!
