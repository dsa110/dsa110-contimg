# Python Version Configuration

## Current Setup

### Conda Environment: Python 3.11.13 :check:

- **Location**: `/opt/conda/envs/cubical/bin/python`
- **Version**: Python 3.11.13
- **Usage**: This is what's used for all CubiCal work
- **Status**: Working perfectly

### System Python: Python 3.8.10

- **Location**: `/usr/bin/python3`
- **Version**: Python 3.8.10 (Ubuntu 20.04 default)
- **Usage**: Only for system tools, not used for CubiCal
- **Status**: Fine for system purposes

## Why Not System Python 3.11.13?

Python 3.11.13 is **not available** as a system package for Ubuntu 20.04:

- Ubuntu 20.04 default repos only have Python 3.8
- The deadsnakes PPA doesn't have Python 3.11 packages for Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.11 was released after Ubuntu 20.04

## Solution: Conda Python 3.11.13

Since we're using conda for the Python environment:

- :check: Conda provides Python 3.11.13 (exactly what we need)
- :check: All packages use conda's Python 3.11.13
- :check: System Python 3.8 is only for system tools (not used for our work)
- :check: This is the standard approach for scientific Python environments

## Summary

**What matters**: Conda Python 3.11.13 is working and is what's used for
everything. **System Python**: 3.8.10 is fine for system tools, doesn't affect
our work.

**Status**: :check: Optimal configuration
