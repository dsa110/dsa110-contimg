# Matches the casa6 environment name for consistency, but contains only
# essential runtime dependencies. The host casa6 environment includes
# additional development tools (black, flake8, pytest), documentation
# tools (mkdocs), Jupyter/IPython, and visualization packages that are
# not needed in Docker containers.
