# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about the DSA-110 pipeline architecture.

## Documentation Files

- **[New Architecture](new_architecture.md)** - Complete architecture overview and design principles
- **[Phase 3 Features](phase3_features.md)** - Advanced features including error recovery, distributed state, and monitoring

## Architecture Overview

The DSA-110 continuum imaging pipeline follows a modular, enterprise-grade architecture with three main phases:

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- Unified pipeline orchestration
- Modular processing stages
- Comprehensive testing framework

### Phase 2: Configuration & Services
- Environment-specific configurations
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Service-based processing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Error recovery and circuit breakers
- Distributed state management
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between different processing stages
2. **Modularity** - Each component is independently testable and maintainable
3. **Scalability** - Architecture supports both single-instance and distributed processing
4. **Reliability** - Built-in error recovery and fault tolerance
5. **Observability** - Comprehensive monitoring and logging throughout

## Getting Started

1. **Understanding the Architecture**: Start with [New Architecture](new_architecture.md)
2. **Advanced Features**: Read [Phase 3 Features](phase3_features.md) for production capabilities
3. **Implementation**: Refer to the main [README](../README.md) for quick start guides
