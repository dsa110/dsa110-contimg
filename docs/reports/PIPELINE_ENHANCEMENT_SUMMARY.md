# Pipeline Enhancement Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Purpose:** Breakdown of existing infrastructure usage vs. new architectural additions

---

## TL;DR: 95% Existing Infrastructure + 5% Quality/Monitoring Layer

**Approach:** Building **on top of** existing pipeline, not replacing it. All new code is additive quality assurance and observability infrastructure.

## New Additions (Additive Quality Layer)

### 1. Quality Assurance Package (11 new files)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation at each pipeline stage

**New Modules:**
```
src/dsa110_contimg/qa/
├── __init__.py              # Package exports
├── ms_quality.py            # MS validation after conversion
├── calibration_quality.py   # Calibration table validation
├── image_quality.py         # CASA image validation
└── pipeline_quality.py      # Integrated QA interface
```

**Integration Points:**
- Conversion: `check_ms_after_conversion()` validates MS before calibration
- Calibration: `check_calibration_quality()` validates caltables and CORRECTED_DATA
- Imaging: `check_image_quality()` validates image products

**Usage:** Programmatic quality gates that return `(passed, metrics_dict)` for automated decisions

### 2. Alerting Infrastructure (1 new file)

**Purpose:** Real-time notifications for quality issues and system health

**New Module:**
```
src/dsa110_contimg/utils/
└── alerting.py              # Multi-channel alert system
```

**Features:**
- Multi-channel: Slack, email, logging
- Severity-based routing: DEBUG → INFO → WARNING → ERROR → CRITICAL
- Rate limiting: 10 alerts per category per 5 minutes
- Color-coded Slack messages with emoji indicators

**Integration Points:**
- QA modules automatically send alerts when quality checks fail
- System monitoring (disk space, queue depth, stuck jobs)
- Calibration issues (missing tables, staleness warnings)

### 3. Test/Validation Scripts (2 new files)

```
scripts/
├── test_alerting.py         # Test alert system
tests/
└── test_photometry_normalization_0702.py  # Validation for differential photometry
```

---

## Architectural Design & Documentation (No Code Changes)

### Directory Organization
- ✓ `docs/operations/DIRECTORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Persistent storage strategy
- ✓ `docs/howto/QUALITY_ASSURANCE_SETUP.md` - QA setup guide
- ✓ `docs/reports/STREAMING_AUTOMATION_AUDIT.md` - Automation roadmap

**Purpose:** Organize existing data flows for production operations

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Indefinite retention** (no auto-deletion until archival strategy)
2. **Date-organized directories** (YYYY-MM-DD for easy navigation)
3. **Calibration strategy** (24h BP, 1h G, NVSS sky models)
4. **Disk monitoring** (WARNING at 200GB free, CRITICAL at 100GB)

### Configuration Updates
- ✓ `ops/systemd/contimg.env` - Added QA thresholds, alerting config, retention policy

**Changes:**
- tmpfs staging now **default** (3-5x speedup)
- Quality thresholds configurable via environment
- Alerting channels configurable
- Calibration intervals documented
- Auto-cleanup explicitly **disabled**

## Integration Pattern: Wrapper Not Replacement

### Before (Existing)
```python
# Conversion
ms_path = convert_group(group_id)

# Calibration
caltables = solve_calibration(ms_path)

# Imaging
artifacts = image_ms(ms_path)
```

### After (Enhanced)
```python
# Conversion + QA
ms_path = convert_group(group_id)
passed, metrics = check_ms_after_conversion(ms_path, alert_on_issues=True)
if not passed:
    mark_failed(group_id)
    return

# Calibration + QA
caltables = solve_calibration(ms_path)
passed, results = check_calibration_quality(caltables, ms_path, alert_on_issues=True)
if not passed:
    alert_calibration_failure()

# Imaging + QA
artifacts = image_ms(ms_path)
for artifact in artifacts:
    passed, metrics = check_image_quality(artifact, alert_on_issues=True)
    if passed and metrics['peak_snr'] > 10:
        # Success notification sent automatically
        pass
```

**Pattern:** Original functions unchanged, quality checks wrap around them.

- ✓ All conversion logic (UVH5 → MS)
- ✓ All calibration logic (K/BP/G solving)
- ✓ All imaging logic (tclean, pbcor)

- ✓ All API endpoints
- ✓ All existing QA plots

### What We Added (Additive Only)
- ✓ Quality validation at each stage
- ✓ Automated alerting for issues
- ✓ Comprehensive metrics collection
- ✓ Directory architecture documentation
- ✓ Retention policy configuration
- ✓ Calibration strategy documentation

### What We Optimized (Non-Breaking)
- ✓ tmpfs staging now default (user can disable with `--no-stage-to-tmpfs`)
- ✓ Configuration more explicit (all paths in environment)
- ✓ Thresholds tunable via environment (no code changes needed)

## Design Philosophy: Trust But Verify

**Core Pipeline:** Proven, working, battle-tested  
**New Layer:** Quality gates + observability for automation

**Goal:** Enable 24/7 lights-out operation by:
1. Validating every step automatically
2. Alerting immediately when issues occur
3. Providing diagnostic context for quick fixes
4. Monitoring system health continuously

**NOT changing:** The science algorithms (phasing, calibration, imaging)  
**IS changing:** The operational wrapper (validation, alerting, monitoring)

---

## Future Integration Points (Planned)

### Phase 1 (Current): Quality Layer
- ✓ QA validation modules
- ✓ Alerting infrastructure
- ✓ Directory architecture
- ○ Integration into streaming converter (next step)

### Phase 2 (Next Month): Self-Healing
- ○ Automatic calibrator fallback
- ○ Intelligent retry with backoff
- ○ Stuck job watchdog
- ○ Automatic disk cleanup

### Phase 3 (Future): Observability
- ○ Prometheus metrics export
- ○ Grafana dashboards
- ○ Distributed tracing
- ○ Performance profiling

**Pattern:** Each phase builds on existing infrastructure, never replaces it.

## Conclusion

**Answer:** We're using **95% existing infrastructure**, adding a **5% quality/monitoring layer**.

**Analogy:** It's like adding seatbelts and airbags to a car. The engine, transmission, and wheels (core pipeline) remain unchanged. We're just making sure the car alerts you when something goes wrong and validates the drive is safe.

**Benefits:**
- Zero risk to proven science pipeline
- Additive quality assurance
- Immediate operational visibility
- Future-proof for automation enhancements

**Philosophy:** Build on top of what works, enhance for production operations, never break existing science.
