# Priority Features Implementation - Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Feature 3 Complete! Features 1 & 2 Backend Complete

---

## What We Built Today

Implemented comprehensive improvements to the DSA-110 Control Panel focusing on the **three highest-priority features** identified through user feedback.

---

## ✓ Feature 3: Data Organization - **COMPLETE**

### Backend ✓
- **Enhanced MSListEntry model** with 8 new fields:
  - Calibrator info: `has_calibrator`, `calibrator_name`, `calibrator_quality`
  - Processing status: `is_calibrated`, `is_imaged`
  - QA metrics: `calibration_quality`, `image_quality`
  - File info: `size_gb`, `start_time`

- **MSListFilters model** for advanced querying:
  - Search by path or calibrator name
  - Filter by calibrator presence, calibration status, imaging status, quality
  - Date range filtering
  - Multiple sort options (time, name, size - asc/desc)
  - Pagination support

- **Rewritten `/api/ms` endpoint** (`routes.py`):
  - Dynamic WHERE clause building based on filters
  - Joins with `pointing_history`, `calibration_qa`, `image_qa` tables
  - On-the-fly file size calculation
  - Returns `total` and `filtered` counts for pagination
  - ~180 lines of sophisticated SQL query construction

### Frontend ✓
- **MSTable component** (`frontend/src/components/MSTable.tsx`):
  - 450+ lines of fully documented React/TypeScript
  - MUI Table with sortable headers
  - Multi-select checkboxes (for future batch operations)
  - Search box (filters path + calibrator name)
  - Filter dropdowns: Calibrator (Yes/No/All), Status (Calibrated/Imaged/Uncalibrated/All)
  - Status badges with color coding:
    - Calibrator quality: excellent (green), good (green), marginal (yellow), poor (red)
    - Processing status: "Cal" and "Img" chips
    - QA quality badges for both calibration and imaging
  - Pagination controls
  - Click row to select MS and scroll to metadata panel
  - Responsive layout

- **Updated ControlPage.tsx**:
  - Removed dropdown, integrated MSTable
  - Added `selectedMSList` state for multi-select
  - Auto-scroll to metadata panel on MS selection
  - Maintained all existing functionality

- **Enhanced API queries** (`queries.ts`):
  - `useMSList(filters)` hook with full filter support
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with examples
  - Type-safe filter parameters

- **Updated types** (`types.ts`):
  - Extended `MSListEntry` interface
  - Added `MSListFilters` interface
  - Updated `MSList` with pagination fields
  - Fully documented with inline comments

---

## ✓ Feature 2: Quality Assessment - **BACKEND COMPLETE**

### What's Ready ✓
- **Database schema**:
  - `calibration_qa` table: K/BP/G metrics, flag fractions, overall quality, timestamp
  - `image_qa` table: RMS, peak flux, dynamic range, beam params, thumbnail path, quality

- **QA extraction functions** (`api/batch_jobs.py`):
  - `extract_calibration_qa(ms_path, job_id, caltables)`:
    - Opens K/BP/G tables using CASA tools
    - Calculates flag fractions, SNR statistics
    - Assigns quality: excellent (<10% flags), good (10-30%), marginal (30-50%), poor (>50%)
    - Returns metrics dict for DB storage
  
  - `extract_image_qa(ms_path, job_id, image_path)`:
    - Extracts RMS noise, peak flux, calculates dynamic range
    - Gets beam parameters (major, minor, PA)
    - Assigns quality: excellent (DR>1000), good (100-1000), marginal (10-100), poor (<10)
  
  - `generate_image_thumbnail(image_path, size=512)`:
    - Reads CASA image, normalizes to 1-99.5 percentile
    - Converts to 8-bit grayscale PNG
    - Resizes using PIL
    - Returns thumbnail path

- **Pydantic models** (`api/models.py`):
  - `CalibrationQA`: Full calibration QA metrics
  - `ImageQA`: Full image QA metrics
  - `QAMetrics`: Combined view

### What's Needed (TODO)
- [ ] API endpoints: `GET /api/qa/calibration/{ms_path}`, `GET /api/qa/image/{ms_path}`
- [ ] Integration with `job_runner.py`: Call QA extraction after calibration/imaging jobs
- [ ] Frontend QA display: Badges in table, detailed panel, thumbnail viewer

---

## ✓ Feature 1: Bulk Operations - **BACKEND COMPLETE**

### What's Ready ✓
- **Database schema**:
  - `batch_jobs` table: Tracks overall batch status, counts
  - `batch_job_items` table: Individual MS within a batch, per-item status

- **Helper functions** (`api/batch_jobs.py`):
  - `create_batch_job(conn, job_type, ms_paths, params)`: Initialize batch in DB
  - `update_batch_item(conn, batch_id, ms_path, job_id, status, error)`: Update item status, recalculate batch progress

- **Pydantic models** (`api/models.py`):
  - `BatchJob`: Overall batch status
  - `BatchJobStatus`: Individual item status
  - `BatchCalibrateParams`, `BatchApplyParams`, `BatchImageParams`
  - `BatchJobCreateRequest`

### What's Needed (TODO)
- [ ] API endpoints: `POST /api/batch/calibrate`, `GET /api/batch/{id}`, etc.
- [ ] Background worker to process batch items sequentially
- [ ] Frontend: "Batch Actions" dropdown, progress modal, cancel button

## Testing

### What Works Now
```bash
# Test enhanced MS list API
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/ms"
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/ms?search=3C286"
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/ms?has_calibrator=true&sort_by=time_desc"
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/ms?is_calibrated=true&limit=20"
```

### What to Test in UI
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3210/dashboard → Control Panel
2. See MS table with columns: Name, Time, Calibrator, Status, Quality, Size
3. Use search box to filter by MS name or calibrator
4. Use dropdown filters: Calibrator (Yes/No), Status (Calibrated/Imaged)
5. Click column headers to sort
6. Click checkbox to multi-select MS (for future batch operations)
7. Click row to select MS and view metadata panel
8. Verify status badges show correct colors
9. Verify pagination works for >25 MS

## Code Quality

### Documentation
- All new functions have comprehensive docstrings
- TypeScript interfaces fully documented with inline comments
- React components include JSDoc with usage examples
- SQL queries have explanatory comments

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript coverage in frontend
- Pydantic models for all API data structures
- Type-safe React hooks

### Performance
- Efficient SQL queries with proper indices
- Client-side filtering for instant feedback
- Pagination to handle large MS lists
- React Query caching for API responses

---

## Next Steps (Remaining Work)

### Phase 2A: QA Integration (2-3 hours)
1. Add API endpoints for QA retrieval
2. Integrate QA extraction into `job_runner.py`
3. Test QA extraction with real calibration/imaging jobs

### Phase 2B: QA Frontend (2 hours)
1. Display QA metrics in MS metadata panel
2. Show image thumbnails
3. Expandable QA details view

### Phase 3: Batch Operations (4-5 hours)
1. Implement batch API endpoints
2. Create background worker for batch processing
3. Build "Batch Actions" UI
4. Create batch progress modal

**Estimated Total Remaining**: ~8-10 hours

---

## Memory Updates

### Key Learnings
1. **MUI Table vs DataGrid**: Used standard MUI Table instead of DataGrid due to package installation conflicts. This worked well and provides more control.

2. **SQL Query Building**: Dynamic WHERE clause construction with parameter binding is elegant and prevents SQL injection.

3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces with optional fields (`?:`) allow gradual feature rollout without breaking existing code.

4. **React State Management**: Separating `selectedMS` (single) from `selectedMSList` (multi-select) provides flexibility for both single-item operations and future batch operations.

5. **Status Badges**: Color-coded chips (success/warning/error) provide instant visual feedback about data quality.

6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline comments and JSDoc significantly improve code maintainability.

### Best Practices Applied
- Backend-first development: API complete before frontend
- Type-driven development: Define types first, implement second
- Component composition: MSTable is fully self-contained and reusable
- Progressive enhancement: New features don't break existing functionality
- Error handling: Graceful degradation when data is missing
