## Open Issues

### Docker WSClean Hang

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** :large_red_circle: Open (Workaround Available)  
**Affects:** NVSS seeding, Docker-based WSClean `-predict` operations

Docker WSClean `-predict` operations hang at "Cleaning up temporary files..."
and never complete. Timeouts don't trigger because the hang occurs at the
Docker/kernel level.

**Workaround:** Disable NVSS seeding (`use_nvss_seeding=False`)

**Full Documentation:** [docker-wsclean.md](docker-wsclean.md)

### Image Metadata Not Populated

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** :large_red_circle: Open  
**Affects:** Image filtering, database queries

Database images have `noise_jy`, `center_ra_deg`, `center_dec_deg` set to NULL,
causing noise filtering to fail and declination filtering to be slow.

**Impact:**

- Noise filtering returns no results
- Declination filtering requires reading FITS files (slow)

## Resolved Issues

### CASA C++ Shutdown Error

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** :white_heavy_check_mark: Resolved  
**Resolution Date:** November 29, 2025

pytest would crash after tests passed with:

```text
casatools::get_state() called after shutdown initiated
```

**Root Cause:** CASA's C++ backend throws during Python's atexit sequence when
its state is accessed after shutdown began.

**Solution:** Track CASA imports during tests and use `os._exit(0)` to skip
Python's normal shutdown when tests pass.

**Full Documentation:**
[resolved/casa-shutdown-error.md](resolved/casa-shutdown-error.md)

### MS Permission Errors

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** :white_heavy_check_mark: Resolved  
**Resolution Date:** November 2025

CASA tasks failed with "Permission denied" errors on Measurement Set files
created with root ownership.

**Solution:** Automated permission fixing integrated into `selfcal.py` and
manual script available.

**Full Documentation:**
[resolved/ms-permission-errors.md](resolved/ms-permission-errors.md)

### Frontend Restart Required

**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** :white_heavy_check_mark: Resolved  
**Resolution Date:** November 2025

Frontend dev server needed restart to pick up `.env.development` changes.

**Solution:** Restart frontend dev server or modify API client directly.
