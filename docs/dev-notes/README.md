# Dev Notes

This folder hosts short-lived engineering scratchpads (TODO lists, investigation
logs, migration checklists, etc.).

Use it for:

- Task backlogs or running checklists that do not belong in versioned guides yet
- Investigation or audit notes that feed into later design docs
- Temporary coordination documents that still need to live in git

Finished guides and runbooks should continue to live under `docs/development/`
(and the other structured docs directories) so long-term references stay
separate from day-to-day scratch material.
