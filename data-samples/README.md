# Data Samples

Curated example outputs for the DSA-110 continuum imaging pipeline.

- `ms/`: Measurement Sets generated by the conversion pipeline for demo/testing
- `images/`: Imaging artifacts (dirty/clean products, QA plots) associated with the sample MS files
- `catalogs/`: Source catalogs or QA summaries derived from the imaging results

Runbooks should note when these samples were produced and how to regenerate them so collaborators can refresh the datasets as the pipeline evolves.
