When making any statement, or quoting any value, ask yourself: "How confident am
I in this answer? Would I bet my existence on this?" If the answer is "no", take
the steps necessary to achieve a level of certainty that would allow you to
answer "yes". If those steps are impossible, state that it is impossible to be
completely certain, and explain why.
